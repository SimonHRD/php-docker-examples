# PHP Docker Examples
A collection of practical examples showing how to run PHP applications with Docker.  
Includes setups with Apache, MariaDB, MongoDB, phpMyAdmin, and Mongo Express.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
This repository contains the following examples:

| Folder         | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `php-only/`    | Basic PHP + Apache setup                   |
| `php-mariadb/` | PHP + MariaDB + phpMyAdmin                 |
| `php-mongodb/` | PHP + MongoDB + Mongo Express (dev/prod)   |

Each folder includes its own `README.md` with setup instructions, `compose.yaml` and application source code.
